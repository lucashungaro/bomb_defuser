Flight missions are given on four different stages, with the player able to choose from six different characters. Three different vehicles are also available for standard missions; the Hang Glider, Rocket Belt and Gyrocopter.</p><h2><strong>Mission Structure</strong></h2><p>Specific mission goals depend on the class of vehicle, however most missions follow the formula of takeoff, task completion and proper landing. Tasks vary from flying through a series of floating rings, to landing on checkpoints, and to taking judged pictures. Missions are also usually based on a time limit, where points are detracted once the player exceeds the time allotted.</p><p>For each mission, 100 points are possible for a Perfect Score from the player. Badges are awarded for obtaining certain point levels, as in a Silver Badge is awarded for the Rocket Belt after passing an average of 80 points or higher on each Rocket Belt mission.</p><p>When landing is required, the player is judged on impact and accuracy. Too hard of an impact anywhere in the level will cause the pilot to crash the plane and the mission to be failed. After each failure, the game offers textual tips for improving the player\u2019s piloting skills.</p><p>Each level of difficulty for the classes of vehicles is designated to a specific island, all four of which display unique traits. The player is also free to choose any character at any given time, which are separated into light, medium, and heavy pilots.</p><h2><strong>Pilots</strong></h2><p>The pilots\u2019 names are taken from bird names in the American version of the game. The lightweight pilots are <a href=\"/kiwi/94-9132/\">Kiwi</a>, the girl, and <a href=\"/lark/94-9127/\">Lark</a>, the boy. These are ideal for the Rocket Belt, as they display an increased maneuverability and speed. The medium weight pilots are <a href=\"/ibis/94-9128/\">Ibis</a>, the woman, and <a href=\"/goose/94-9130/\">Goose</a>, the man, both of which are suited for the Hang Glider. The heaviest pilots, the woman <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/robin/94-9131/\">Robin</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.giantbomb.com/hawk/94-9129/\">Hawk</a>, the male, are best fitted for the Gyrocopter.</p><h2><strong>Vehicle Classes</strong></h2><p>The analog stick controls the Hang Glider\u2019s movement, while an additional button can flare the glider\u2019s wings for speed adjustments. Pilots must ensure they stay in the air long enough to complete the tasks while also landing properly. Hot air columns allow the Hang Glider to receive a significant amount of lift. Photography is also designated to Hang Glider missions, with each photo being stored in the photo album.</p><p>The Rocket Belts are more complicated than the Hang Gliders, allowing the player to control a jet pack that sends the player hovering at high altitudes and high speeds. Two buttons are designated to different amounts of thrust, one at full engine power, and the other at half. Hovering is also possible by the trigger button, allowing precise pilot movement, proving the Rocket Belt to be a favorite among many players.</p><p>The Gyrocopter takes off and lands similar to an airplane, with in flight controls responding similarly. Extremely low speeds are possible due to the helicopter fashioned design, but high speeds are also easily attainable during timed missions. The Gyrocopter is also equipped with a missile launcher while players have access to an unending supply of missiles. These are often used to either hit practice targets, or defeat the only enemy in the game, the Godzilla-like \u201cMeca Hawk.\u201d</p><h2><strong>Additional Modes</strong></h2><p>The Birdman mode equips pilots with bird-like wings attached to their arms. During these stages, the player is free to explore the island at their leisure, as this is not a timed mission, nor are there any tasks. The different weather modes are also available, ranging in sunny, cloudy, evening and night.</p><p>Sky Diving is also another mode where the pilots must complete in air formations with a following parachute landing on specific targets. The player only has a limited amount of time to complete each formation, as the altitude drops rapidly during the freefall.</p><p>A Cannonball mode lets players aim their pilot in a giant canon, and shoot them out towards a target, similarly to a circus clown as the missions\u2019 soundtrack suggests.</p><p>The Jumble Hopper fits the pilots with oversized boots, propelling the pilot vertical and forward with force, as the goal is to reach the destination in as few hops as possible. Landing in river water will not cause the player to crash, however, points will be deducted from the final score.</p><h2><strong>Locations</strong></h2><p>Holiday Island is the starting location for each class of vehicle. This island is the smallest in the game, featuring attractions such as an amusement park complete with a Ferris wheel, and a mountaintop mansion.</p><p>Crescent Island features a beach location, as well as an extensive cave system cutting through its main mountain ridge. Many coastal homes can be seen on the outskirts of the island, while the inside features resorts, complete with pools and tennis courts. Luxury liners also inhabit the waters nearby.</p><p>Ever-Frost Island is an island permanently covered in snow, featuring tall peaks and sharp vertical drops. An oil refinery sits between some of the small islets, while a ski resort is build upon the main island.</p><p>The Little States is a miniature replica of the United States, with a shrunken Mississippi River, Grand Canyon, and Rocky Mountain region. Major cities are represented as small groupings of skyscrapers, while some national monuments, such as the Washington Monument, or Mount Rushmore, exist in smaller scale. Mount Rushmore, in fact, features the likeness of Mario next to the American presidents.</p>", "deck": "Take control of six characters and take part in hand-gliding, rocket-belting, and gyrocopter-ing as you pass tests in this crazy flight simulator for the N64.", "aliases": "", "image": {"icon_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3509/662161-pilotwings64_jp_icon.jpg", "medium_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3509/662161-pilotwings64_jp_small.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3509/662161-pilotwings64_jp_tiny.jpg", "small_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3509/662161-pilotwings64_jp_small.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3509/662161-pilotwings64_jp_thumb.jpg", "screen_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3509/662161-pilotwings64_jp_screen.jpg", "super_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3509/662161-pilotwings64_jp_super.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/pilotwings-64/61-108/", "api_detail_url": "http://api.giantbomb.com/game/108/", "number_of_user_reviews": 2, "original_release_date": "1996-09-29 00:00:00", "original_game_rating": null, "expected_release_month": null, "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:33:11", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 108, "name": "Pilotwings 64"}, {"date_last_updated": "2008-08-26 18:46:48", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "", "deck": "", "aliases": "", "image": {"icon_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3413/277392-fly_harder_cover_icon.jpg", "medium_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3413/277392-fly_harder_cover_small.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3413/277392-fly_harder_cover_tiny.jpg", "small_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3413/277392-fly_harder_cover_small.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3413/277392-fly_harder_cover_thumb.jpg", "screen_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3413/277392-fly_harder_cover_screen.jpg", "super_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/3413/277392-fly_harder_cover_super.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fly-harder/61-109/", "api_detail_url": "http://api.giantbomb.com/game/109/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_release_date": null, "original_game_rating": null, "expected_release_month": null, "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:33:12", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 109, "name": "Fly Harder"}, {"date_last_updated": "2008-08-26 18:47:35", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "", "deck": "", "aliases": "", "image": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/kids-kards/61-110/", "api_detail_url": "http://api.giantbomb.com/game/110/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_release_date": null, "original_game_rating": null, "expected_release_month": null, "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:33:12", "expected_release_year": null, "id": 110, "name": "Kid's Kards"}, {"date_last_updated": "2010-12-10 18:06:30", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "In Choplifter II you play as a rescue helicopter and you try to rescue some hostages on an enemy territory.", "deck": "Choplifter II is the sequel to the Game Boy exclusive Choplifter.", "aliases": "Choplifter 2: Rescue Survive", "image": {"icon_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/11/117225/1654191-250px_choplifter2gb_icon.jpg", "medium_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/11/117225/1654191-250px_choplifter2gb_small.jpg", "tiny_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/11/117225/1654191-250px_choplifter2gb_tiny.jpg", "small_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/11/117225/1654191-250px_choplifter2gb_small.jpg", "thumb_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/11/117225/1654191-250px_choplifter2gb_thumb.jpg", "screen_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/11/117225/1654191-250px_choplifter2gb_screen.jpg", "super_url": "http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/11/117225/1654191-250px_choplifter2gb_super.jpg"}, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/choplifter-ii-rescue-survive/61-111/", "api_detail_url": "http://api.giantbomb.com/game/111/", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_release_date": null, "original_game_rating": null, "expected_release_month": 9, "date_added": "2008-04-01 01:33:12", "expected_release_year": 1991, "id": 111, "name": "Choplifter II: Rescue Survive"}, {"date_last_updated": "2011-03-15 08:17:12", "expected_release_quarter": null, "description": "<h2>Overview</h2>Space reporter <a href=\"/ulala/94-31/\">Ulala</a> is back on the scene with a thrilling sequel to <a href=\"/space-channel-5/61-7466/\">Space Channel 5</a> that improves on the original in every conceivable way. Sega delivers improved music, expanded game mechanics and oodles of the 60s sci-fi style that made Space Channel 5 a cult classic, despite the low sales. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Space Channel 5: Part 2 was originally released on <a href=\"/dreamcast/60-37/\">Dreamcast</a> in Japan, but was not brought to the United States. Fortunately for fans, <a href=\"/agetec-inc/65-39/\">Agetec</a> released a double pack of the Dreamcast games for <a href=\"/playstation-2/60-19/\">Playstation 2</a>. The emulation was perfect, which was surprising given the budget price of $20 for the game. In 2011, the game was released as a digital download on <a href=\"/steam/92-718/\">Steam</a> and <a href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/60-86/\">Xbox Live Marketplace</a>&nbsp;as a part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"/dreamcast-collection/61-33847/\">Dreamcast Collection</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Story</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1360629\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/6/63492/1360629-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.38.19_pm_super.png\" title=\"The Rhythm Rouges have invaded the galaxy, and are forcing people to dance! \u00a0\"><img id=\"1360629\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/6/63492/1360629-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.38.19_pm_thumb.png\" alt=\"The Rhythm Rouges have invaded the galaxy, and are forcing people to dance! \u00a0\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Rhythm Rouges have invaded the galaxy, and are forcing people to dance! \u00a0</div></div></div></div>     The galaxy is threatened yet again by evildoers with wicked dance moves! This time, the robotic Rhythm Rogues have kidnapped over 300,000 people throughout the galaxy! The villainous Purge kidnaps Space President Peace and demands a ransom of 6.6 trillion space dollars which must be delivered to point Double X! Intrepid reporter Ulala is back on the scene, and will get to the bottom of the story with her funky dance moves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />To get the scoop, Ulala must reunite with the characters of the first Space Channel 5, including Jaguar, Pudding and Space Michael! New allies like Pine, a member of the Sexy Space Police are there to help her. With a whole new cast of bosses to dance battle, Ulala will need every bit of help.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><h2>Gameplay</h2>Space Channel 5 is a variant of the 80s electronic game \"Simon Says,\" where players must match the commands in rhythm to the music.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, a captured character might request the sequence, \"Up, down, up, down, chu, chu, chu!\" Players would have to press \"Up, down, up, down, X, X, X\" in rhythm to the music. To succeed, a sense of rhythm and a good memory are key. Often, on screen cues remind the player of the sequence. For instance, two chu commands would be visually indicated with two robots. If the sequence is correctly entered, the player is rewarded with seeing the robots blasted.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This sequel introduces several new gameplay mechanics that make the experience more complex. A \"Recuse\" beam is added to Ulala's arsenal, which is activated with the circle button. The beam is used to rescue hostages. If the button is not pressed at the correct time, the hostage is not rescued and they are not added to the list of biographies on the title screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The second gameplay mechanic that has been added is the hold function. For instance, Ulala might get the command sequence \"Chu! Chu! Chuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu! Chu!\" Ulala would have to hold the X button on the third input for the correct amount of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1360645\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/6/63492/1360645-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.45.50_pm_super.png\" title=\"A Morolian pops on screen when the correct secret command is inputed\u00a0\"><img id=\"1360645\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/6/63492/1360645-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.45.50_pm_thumb.png\" alt=\"A Morolian pops on screen when the correct secret command is inputed\u00a0\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">A Morolian pops on screen when the correct secret command is inputed\u00a0</div></div></div></div>     Secrets have been added to the gameplay, which boost Ulala's ratings. The key is to hit X at the correct time in the cutscenes. For example, on the first stage if you press X for the second and third notes of the \"Mexican Flyer\" opening theme song, Morolians pop out of the edges of the screen and Ulala gets a boost to her ratings. Finding secrets is not critical for success, but does give the player more room to make mistakes in boss battles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Rather than having a set number of hearts, or allowable mistakes during boss battles - the number is calculated based on her ratings. This is a major change from the original game, and makes the gameplay before the boss sequences more important. Do well and you will have plenty of extra chances should you make a mistake. Do poorly and expect to repeat the level.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Also, in the original, enemies popped in after the end of every sequence, requiring Ulala to blast them with an single Chu command. This is largely the same, but instead of blasting them Ulala strikes a funky dance pose.<br /><h2>Characters &nbsp;</h2><b><a href=\"/ulala/94-31/\">Ulala</a></b>&nbsp;<br /><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1360566\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/6/63492/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm_super.png\" title=\"Ulala poses with her trademark microphone\"><img id=\"1360566\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/6/63492/1360566-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.15.25_pm_thumb.png\" alt=\"Ulala poses with her trademark microphone\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ulala poses with her trademark microphone</div></div></div></div>     The heroine of Space Channel 5, who the player almost always controls.

In the original game, she discovered that Blank, the CEO of Space Channel 5 was controlling the Morolians and forcing them to invade the galaxy for ratings. Players can look forward to unlocking new outfits for her on every stage.

He's responsible for kidnapping Space President Peace and for stealing the transmitter for Space Channel 5. He could be said to have an effeminate voice and manner, and has a white loop of hair wildly reaching for the sky. &nbsp;Purge has control of Shadow, and frequently appears on television screens to command him. In the final boss battle, we learn that his true reason for kidnapping hundreds of thousands of people is to force the galaxy to watch his television show.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Space President Peace&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;<br /><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1360606\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/6/63492/1360606-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.34.16_pm_super.png\" title=\"Space President Peace before his kidnapping\u00a0\"><img id=\"1360606\" src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/6/63492/1360606-screen_shot_2010_05_02_at_9.34.16_pm_thumb.png\" alt=\"Space President Peace before his kidnapping\u00a0\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Space President Peace before his kidnapping\u00a0</div></div></div></div>     Ulala's main mission in this sequel is to rescue the Space President, who has been kidnapped by Purge. Ulala must be careful not to hit him while saving him. For example, in stage 4 Shadow seals the president inside a giant dancing robot. Ulala must enter in the opposite of the sequence given in order to rescue him. For instance, Purge says \"Left, right, chu\" Ulala must enter \"Right, Left, Chu.\" Space President Peace also sings the song for the closing credits of the game. He wears glasses with star shaped frames.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Soundtrack</h2>Like the previous game in the series, the soundtrack to Space Channel 5: Part 2 was primarily composed by <a href=\"/naofumi-hataya/72-33675/\">Naofumi Hayata</a>, but was joined by a series of collaborators including&nbsp;<a href=\"/mariko-nanba/72-91807/\">Mariko Nanba</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"/tomoya-ohtani/72-40721/\">Tomoya Ohtani</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"/kenichi-tokoi/72-54819/\">Kenichi Tokoi</a>.

Still, reviews were favorable. IGN gave Space Channel 5 a 7.4 and praised its budget price of $20. Reviewer Douglass Perry noted, \"It's a steal. If you have any mind for music games, you need Space Channel 5. \"&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Gamespot was more mixed in its analysis, giving the game a 6.9. Reviewer <a href=\"/brad-shoemaker/72-89869/\">Brad Shoemaker</a> mused, \"It's a little rough around the edges, but Ulala is still swinging.\" He went on to praise the style of the game. \"Every so often you run into a game that's a little short on gameplay, but so long on quirky appeal that you can't help loving it.\"&nbsp;", "deck": "This sequel to the Dreamcast cult classic delivers 60s sci-fi style in spades.
